/** A skeleton class to represent parse trees.
 *  The arity is not fixed: a node can have 0, 1 or more children.
 *  Trees are represented in the following way:
 *                        Tree :== TreeLabel * List<Tree>
 *  In other words, trees are defined recursively:
 *  A tree is a root (with a label of type TreeLabel) and a list of trees children.
 *  Thus, a leave is simply a tree with no children (its list of children is empty).
 *  This class can also be seen as representing the Node of a tree,
 *  in which case a tree is simply represented as its root.
